# Discord.js-example
This is just an example of a discord.js bot. Feel free to use since i credited myself in the command. But i reccomend you don't copy the whole code into yours because that will make you into a copier and you will probably copy other stuff too.

>If you are new to discord.js, i reccomend you check out these useful guides below:
